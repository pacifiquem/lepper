# Contributing to npx-proj
I love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer


I actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!


#### Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/pacifiquem/npx-proj/issues/new)

I use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/pacifiquem/npx-proj/issues/new); it's that easy!

#### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- Be specific!
- Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
